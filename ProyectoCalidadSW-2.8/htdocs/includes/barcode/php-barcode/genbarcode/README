Genbarcode 0.4

Genbarcode can't generate barcode-images, but a string which can
be used by image-creators, such as my PHP-Barcode

Encoding is done using GNU-Barcode (libbarcode), which can be found
at http://www.gnu.org/software/barcode/

UNIX-INSTALLATION:

First of all you need GNU barcode, a barcode creation/encoding library.
GNU barcode can be foud at http://www.gnu.org/software/barcode/ , or
install it using your favourite package-manager, e.g.
    debian: # apt-get install barcode
    SuSE  : # rpm -i /path-to/barcode.rpm ; rpm -i /path-to/barcode/devel.rpm 
Or compile and install the source yourself:
    $ tar xfvz barcode-0.98.tar.gz
    $ cd barcode-0.98
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    become root ( $ su )
    # make install
    # ldconfig

Then compile genbarcode:
    Just type 
    $ make
    become root ( $ su )
    # make install

BSD Notice:
You have to use gmake (GNU version of make), which can be found in the
ports-collection. Take a look at /usr/ports/devel/gmake and 'make install'.
Then type instead of 'make' 'gmake'


WINDOWS-INSTALLATION:

You can compile genbarcode with Borlands Free C++Builder Command Lines Tools 5.5
You need the windows-source-package, which includes gnu-barcode-0.98 and libpaper
Make-win.inc assumes that C++Builder has been installed to c:\borland\bcc55
run 
   c:\borland\bcc55\bin\bcc32 -f Makefile-win
and copy the created file genarcode.exe to any directory.



That's all.

The three lines:
Line 1: The bars
Line 2: The positions for the single characters
Line 3: What encoding has been used

The bar-string:
Read char by char, all odd chars represent a space, all even a bar:
<space-width><bar-width><space-width><bar-width>...

An alphabetic character defines a tall bar, all others small ones.

The character-string:
<position>:<font-size>:<character> ...
 
For programmers:
1. Count the total width using bar-string
2. Allocate the image
3. Paint the bars (bar-string)
4. Write the Text
