## Converter TrueType Fonts for FPDF ##

makefont this version has been modified to work in command line with the client version of PHP.

First you need the utility to generate the metric:
http://ttf2pt1.sourceforge.net/download.html

Windows binary: http://www.fpdf.org/fr/dl.php?id=21


## Create file Metrics ##

Here is the command line to create a metric light:

ttf2pt1-b-L cp1250.map comic.ttf comic

cp1250.map: mapping file located in the directory makefont
comic.ttf: TrueType font to be converted
comic name of the police to release, in principle the same name as the TTF.

We then get the files comic.pfb and comic.afm
Copy the 2 files in the directory "/dev/fpdf/tmp"

## Create file of the police php ##

type in command line with the client version of php (php-cli):

php convert.php TYPE_OF_FONT NAME_OF_FONT [ENCODING]

TYPE_OF_FONT: set to 1 for TrueType or 2 for Type1, we will here 2.
NAME_OF_FONT: put the name of the police here in the example "comic".
ENCODING: optional, set the encoding type, default "cp1250" enough for our use.

example:
php convert.php 2 comic

You will get a file named: comic.php that you can put in the directory "/htdocs/includes/fpdf/fpdf/font/"

## Declare the font in a template ##

if you want to use a new font in a pdf you must add this line to enable it:

$pdf->AddFont('Comic);

if your policy is in bold, you create a file named comicb.php eg
therefore you must declare it like this in the model:

$pdf->AddFont('Comic','B');
